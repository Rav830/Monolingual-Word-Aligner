To get the stanford models to work 

we need certain environment variables set

NER -> STANFORD_MODELS
POS -> STANFORD_MODELS
Parser -> STANFORD_PARSER and STANFORD_MODELS

the stanford models is a colon separated list of paths

The api for nltk allows for path specification for NER and POS

and for the parser ... why do people even set environment variables ... probs on a server

Command to start server

java -mx4g -cp "*" edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.StanfordCoreNLPServer -preload tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner -port 9000 -timeout 15000

** Make sure that the java version being run is 1.8
