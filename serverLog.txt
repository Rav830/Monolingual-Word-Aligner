He definitely does kind of really want to be that chief, and commander, so I feel like by chiming in, and what he said was that they needed an army to hunt, he kind of just wants to confirm, and kind of state that he agrees with Ralph, but also subliminally show that he's also fit to be a leader as well.

I also think that throughout the story so far, he always doesn't let Piggy talk whenever he tries to talk.
[pool-1-thread-4] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43136] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse
And I think he does this because he knows Piggy's pretty intelligent, and he just doesn't want to let him talk because he doesn't want to be overshadowed by what Piggy has to say, because he doesn't want the attention to be brought off of him, and not let it go to Piggy, who I think he feels doesn't deserve attention, for some reason that I don't think has been stated so far.
[pool-1-thread-5] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43136] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse

[pool-1-thread-8] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43136] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse
So he already doesn't seem to like Piggy.
[pool-1-thread-1] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43136] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse

[pool-1-thread-2] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43136] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse
So then that might lead to some kind of conflict between Jack and Piggy in the future.
[pool-1-thread-3] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43152] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse
I see how that agrees with Jack's character, because he's always looking to take out everything else first by his hunting character, rather than being the first one to settle and build off.
[pool-1-thread-4] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43152] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse
And while Ralph and Piggy are trying to settle down, build shelters, build a fire, Jack's more concerned with taking on the pigs, hunting in his most savage character.
[pool-1-thread-5] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43152] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse
I think Jack understands that Ralph was elected leader, but I think he still very much views himself as the leader of the group, and sees himself as more powerful than Ralph, even if Ralph was elected.
[pool-1-thread-6] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43152] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse

[pool-1-thread-7] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43152] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse

[pool-1-thread-2] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43152] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse
He kind of feels that Ralph and Piggy are almost stealing his ideas and his discoveries, which I feel like that's just making people a little bit frustrated and upset with him.
[pool-1-thread-3] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43152] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse
I think that, by making them for both the fire and hunting, I think he's wanting to take too much power all at once, because if he and the choir mess up hunting and maintaining the fire, then it kind of messes up for the whole group of kids.
[pool-1-thread-4] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43152] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse

[pool-1-thread-5] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43152] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse

[pool-1-thread-6] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43152] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse
Going off what St 16 said, I don't think Jack sees the consequences of being a leader, because even though he takes on responsibilities for the hunting, and keeping the fire going, if he does something wrong, like Jake said, he's going to be blamed for the whole thing.
[pool-1-thread-7] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43152] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse
So I think he only sees the good part in being leader, but he doesn't see the consequences.
[pool-1-thread-8] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43152] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse
Likewise, both the hunters and the people who are tending the fire takes a lot of work, and there's a lot of them that are needed to accomplish such a big task, because they're both very important on the island.
[pool-1-thread-1] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43152] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse
You need meat basically to survive, but you also need fire because it could be used to cook the food, as well as to alert ships, oncoming ships, that they're on the island, or heat them when it gets cold or when the time has come.
[pool-1-thread-2] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43152] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse
So you need to keep this fire going because there's so many things that it can do for you, but on the other hand, Jack thinks that it's very important to hunt because they need this meat.
[pool-1-thread-3] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43152] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse
So there's a lot of people needed for both of these tasks, which will make a problem arise.
[pool-1-thread-4] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43162] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse
Right, so just to conclude, everyone's thinking Jack is a power-hungry boy who wants to be leader, and with absolute control?
[pool-1-thread-5] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43162] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse
Yeah, that's shown through ... Ralph's major goals were hunting and with the fire, and Jack immediately takes control and says, "I'll let my group decide this."
[pool-1-thread-6] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43162] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse
And he sees the positives of it, because if it is successful, he gets all the credit, but if it is detrimental, he does not get blamed, because none of the kids are intelligent enough, except for Piggy, who mentions that they're acting like a lot of kids.
[pool-1-thread-7] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43162] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse

[pool-1-thread-8] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43164] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse
Earlier, when Jack said he's trying to gain the respect of everyone, I feel like to avoid anyone doubting him if he messes up, I don't think he's trying to get a lot of respect.
[pool-1-thread-1] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43164] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse

[pool-1-thread-2] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43164] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse
So I think he's trying to do that in order to sort of, if he messes up, then people will fear him and they won't really stand up to him, so it will give him more authority that way too.
[pool-1-thread-3] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43164] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse

That's why I said that was like, there, he's trying to gain some respect so he can get the leader, chief position, but then I think if he gets that, then he's going to turn into some[thing worse] kind of a tyrant or so.
[pool-1-thread-6] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43164] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse
Just looking at this in terms of simple first-world problems, there could be issues such as who is responsible for which task, because one job may be more preferable than the other, therefore leaving kind of an imbalance of where the people are and where they're working.
[pool-1-thread-7] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43164] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse

To go back to St 8's question, I feel like since Ralph didn't have his dad around, I feel like he developed and had to be independent on his own and developed how to be independent, which allowed him to be a good leader, really knowing his strengths and his weaknesses in order to control the boys.
[pool-1-thread-8] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43180] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse

[pool-1-thread-8] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43180] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse
Well I thought that Piggy was trying to sort of provide a counter claim for Ralph's sort of foolish claim that, “Oh my Dad's in the Navy, he's going to come rescue us all, very soon.” And he's saying that, “No one actually knows where on an island so we're probably going to be here for a while.” And this relates to Golding's purpose, because he wanted to write about how when you cut people off towards civilization, they become savage.
[pool-1-thread-1] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43180] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse
But this is the moment where they're saying that now you are totally cut off from civilization, so this is where the story starts to go into Golding's purpose.
[pool-1-thread-2] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43180] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse
Going off of what St 15 just said, Golding did write this in response to Coral Island, and he wrote this in order to show the bad side of people and how they would react apart from civilization.
[pool-1-thread-3] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43180] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse
So making Piggy say that they're not going to be rescued, and thinking, and being realistic, and not actually optimistic in this situation, I think that really breaks down why Golding wrote this story.
[pool-1-thread-4] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43180] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse
Expanding on what both of you guys said about the thematic idea of savagery versus civilization, I think it hasn't been explicitly stated yet, but it can be inferred that there is a lot of savageness that will come on the island.

[pool-1-thread-7] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43180] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse
Along with that, I think that Golding's purpose was again, as a response to Coral Island, is showing how if people are in this kind of situation they'll react to a savage way.
[pool-1-thread-8] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43180] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse

[pool-1-thread-1] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43180] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse

[pool-1-thread-3] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43180] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse
And Piggy doesn't even have opinions, he's being realistic that it's fairly unlikely they're going to be rescued, but they completely disregard it because they believe that their viewpoint's correct.
[pool-1-thread-4] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43180] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse
I'm going to agree with what everyone said, and I'm going to say that it shows that he has a mature side to him, because he knows that there is a chance that they won't be rescued, and they're going to have to start a way to find their own way off of the island, and everyone else is kind of thinking, “Oh we don't really, we can just have fun while we're here, and we'll get rescued eventually.
[pool-1-thread-5] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43180] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse

[pool-1-thread-6] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43180] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse

[pool-1-thread-7] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43180] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse
I agree with St 9 and St 4, because to me Piggy is the most realistic person on the island, because everyone else thinks that someone will come rescue them, but Piggy realizes that since no one's going to come soon that they need to take steps in order to survive.
[pool-1-thread-8] INFO CoreNLP - [/127.0.0.1:43180] API call w/annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner,parse,depparse
I agree with St 4 and St 5, because Piggy is the one that suggested that they make the shelters down by the beach so they have a place to live while they're trying to survive to get off the island.

Looking at all the boys and just their traits in general, I feel like Piggy and Ralph are kind of lenient and level-headed and not really as assertive as Jack is, so any one of those two, Piggy or Ralph, more likely than not, Piggy, since he has the intelligence, as opposed to Ralph's just physical appearance.

Well, with an assertive character like Jack and a character like Piggy, I feel like they would kind of level out at a good middle point where they're not too lenient that they're getting nothing done and their chances of getting rescued is lower and lower, but not too assertive where they're not having enough fun and it's just leading to a bunch of other complications.
